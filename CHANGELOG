v2.1.1 Added Gemfile
* Support bundler usage

v2.1.0 gc-pruned ruby-processing-2.0
 * Since BFG tool was used for archive pruning
 * This repo is not compatible with forks of jashkenas prior to this release

v2.0.1 First minor revision for ruby-processing-2.0
  * Changes for application export on Windows and linux
  * Added support for 'require_relative' on export

v2.0.0 A major revision, now based on processing-2.0 and JRuby 1.7+
  * Processing updated to processing-2.0.1 export to applet has disappeared, also P3D is 
  * the new OPENGL (except Jogl2 instead of Jogl1.1) if you've got an old graphics card or even some new netbook 
  * with onboard graphics you may have issues.
  * https://forum.processing.org/topic/processing-2-0-won-t-run-on-netbooks-and-older-cheaper-hardware. 
  * Processing-2.0  has its own event system (replacing java.awt.event), ruby-processing sketches will normally 
  * use this event system.
  * JRuby upgraded to 1.7.4 (default is ruby 1.9 and 2.0 is possible with a switch)
  * NB: bare sketches replace class wrapped sketches see samples...
  * Samples have been extended to include vanilla processing library examples.
  * References to the 'online' variable have been removed (deprecated in processing-2.0 slated for removal)
  * test suite now uses MiniTest some old tests have been remove. Others that probably will fail anyway, are
  * temporarily marked as skip.	
  * Samples now rely on ruby 1.9 (almost 2.0) and processing-2.0 
  * Where possible examples have been 'fixed' to run with new version (backward compability is not possible)

v1.0.11 Fixing broken stuffs...
  * JRuby upgraded to 1.6.5
  * applet export fixed
  * application export fixed

v1.0.10 Solidifying before Processing 2.0 ...
  * JRuby upgraded to 1.6.4
  * Processing upgraded to 1.5.1
  * load_library now works for Ruby and Java libraries present in the libraries Processing sketchbook
  * test suite created
  * removed ruby-processing specific hex() and shape() methods in favor of Processing ones
  * added some missing methods from Processing: println(), min(), max(), abs(), binary(), nf*(), etc...
  * watcher: watch for *.rb files inside sketch directory
  * linux opengl bugs fixed
  * samples/peasy_cam/hilbert_fractal example now allow the possibility of changing the fractal depth and to more correctly centre the fractal
  * added configuration file in $HOME/.rp5rc to configure java_args and sketchbook_path

v1.0.9 The Yearly Update...
  * JRuby upgraded to 1.4.0 final.
  * Fix to allow arguments to be passed to sketches.
  * Allow "shape" to be called with a block.
  * Added new examples, including Monkstone's 3D Anar library and Hilbert curve.

v1.0.8 Polishing the Windows...
  * Windows Application exporting works again, merely by virtue of
    not cluttering up the classpath.
  * Safer Ruby Platform detection.
  
v1.0.7 Stability...
  * Added preliminary support for embedding Ruby-Processing in the Processing
    IDE (see the ruby-processing-plugin project).
  * Added 'width' and 'height' as methods that should get proxied down
    to inner classes and classes that include the Processing::Proxy.
  * Fixed a padding bug that put tiny gray margins on Windows and Linux.
  * Updated JRuby to 1.2.0 final as well as the Processing libraries. 
  * Got a little bit better at detecting full-screen support on Linux.
  * Fixed some applet and app exporting problems on Windows.
  * The Boids library had a speed limit fix that should make 'em less flighty.
  * Peter Krenn contributed a simple Pong example.
  
v1.0.6 Inner Classes...
  * Java-style inner classes. Any inner class of a sketch will now have the 
    Processing methods and constants proxied down for convenience.
  * Sketches with tiny sizes get displayed in a nicer fashion.
  * New Blue Logo: Ruby-Processing, literally.
  * Moumar contributed a patch for the control_panel library, allowing your
    sliders and buttons to have an initial value.
    
v1.0.5 Spring Cleaning...
  * The "Learning Processing" examples are now a separate project, a 
    long-merited change. They'll grow up on their own at 
    http://github.com/jashkenas/learning-processing-with-ruby
  * The watcher is now a bit better about catching recoverable exceptions.
  * load_strings and save_strings methods have been added to Processing::App.
  * Fixing a permissions problem with applet/application exporting.

v1.0.4 Bare is Beautiful...
  * Ruby-Processing now supports "bare" sketches, which are sketches that 
    consist of only setup and draw methods, or sketches that contain no method
    definitions at all (implicitly wrapping them in a 'setup'). This works
    by pre-processing the code.
  * Initialization heavily tweaked so that size() works as in Processing,
    from within setup(), and so that you can call full_screen as a class method,
    in your class definition, to avoid the need for explicit sketch instantiation.
  * "rp5 create" has a "--bare" option.
  * Many samples now use the bare style, and more "Learning Processing" examples
    were contributed by Juris Galang.

v1.0.3 Tweaks and Tuneups...
  * "rp5 watch" is now a bit more robust, and tries to reload every
  * file, global, and constant that it thinks it needs to.
  * Many, many examples have been contributed by Marc Chung, 
    Peter Krenn, and Florian Jenett.
  * Andreas Haller contributed a patch that added Ruby-1.9 compatibility.
  * The render mode now defaults to JAVA2D, as does Processing.
  * "rp5 create" now informs you of the file it just created.
  * "key" now returns a character, if ASCII and the integer value otherwise,
    mirroring Processing's behavior.
  * Numbers now have the methods 'degrees' and 'radians', for ease.

v1.0.2 Bugfixes and Java Args...
  * Application exporting, long plagued, should now be a little
    closer to rock-solid. If you need to pass command-line options
    to the JVM, add a java_args.txt file in your sketch's data 
    folder that sets stack size, memory size, or whatever ails you.

v1.0.1 Gemmin' it up.
  * The smallest version bump is the biggest change:
    Ruby-Processing has undergone a great refactor, kicked off by
    Peter Gassner's initial efforts to make a gem out of it. Now
    available as a real RubyGem.
    
  * Changes all around: The main interface to Ruby-Processing is now
    through the 'rp5' command. Try rp5 --help to get started.

  * has_slider has been superseded by control_panel, a more full-
    fledged library for controlling aspects of your sketch. Read
    how to use it on the wiki, or check out jwishy.rb

v1.0. Ruby-Processing goes 1.0 with Processing 1.0
  * Processing updated to 1.0.1 (congrats to the Processing team),
    and JRuby updated to the latest trunk. Most sketches run a good
    bit faster now.
    
  * Ruby-Processing now comes with many default libraries: Boids, DXF,
    Javascript, Minim, Net, OpenGL, PDF, Serial, Slider, and Video
    are now included in the download.
    
  * has_slider moved out into an included ruby library.

v0.9. Multi-platform Application export, live coding, and more.
  * Inspired by NodeBox, Ruby-Processing now sports the ability 
    to have sliders control numeric variables in your sketches.
    If you're using an instance variable, say, @speed, to control 
    the speed of your sketch. 
    
    has_slider :speed
    
    Will bring up a panel alongside with a slider that controls 
    the speed. It can take a range of values as an optional parameter. 
    Check out and run jwishy.rb for an example.
  
  * Multi-platform app export! Exporting your Ruby-Processing 
    apps will now create executable apps for Mac/Windows/Linux.
    
  * Live coding support. Now you can do script/live path/to/sketch.rb 
    to open up an interactive session with your sketch available
    as $app.
    
  * Nick Sieger donated an additional sample.

v0.8. Exporting Applications
  * Ruby-Processing can now export Mac applications! Running 
    script/application my_sketch.rb will create MySketch.app, 
    complete with all of its data and libraries. If you have 
    a .icns file inside of your data folder, it will become 
    the app's icon.
    
  * Added a mathematical Fern sample. It's a port of Luis 
    Correia's java original, with algorithms from Wikipedia.
    
  * Sketches now have a library_loaded? method, so that you can 
    check if a library has been started successfully, and 
    conditionally enable things. (Good for OpenGL.)
    
  * The Boids library is now about 40% faster. It also comes with
    an example in library/boids/samples.
    
  * Specs have been started both for exporting and for Ruby-
    Processing itself.

v0.7. Flocking Boids and OpenGL Applets
  * Thanks to MenTaLguY, once again, for work on the JRubyApplet, OpenGL 
    is now a first-class citizen. If you're using OpenGL in your sketch, 
    the applet exporter should just work. It has also been moved and 
    renamed, so now you can use it like:
    
    script/applet my_sketch.rb
  
  * An app generator has been added for getting started. It'll give you 
    a template for an empty Ruby-Processing sketch, with setup and draw
    methods and all that. Usage:
    
    script/generate my_sketch 800 600
    
    Will create a file called my_sketch.rb, with a title of "My Sketch",
    800 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall. Width and height are optional.
    
  * Ruby-Processing now includes its first pure-Ruby library, a port 
    of Tom de Smedt's "Boids", for algorithmic flocking.

v0.6. Generating Applets
  * Now we're baking up some applet pie. The applet_tree script will 
    take your Ruby-Processing sketch, export it as an applet, and 
    generate an HTML page for you to post. It's way easier now than it 
    would have been before. (thanks to MenTaLguY.) Use it like so:
    
    ./applet_tree my_sketch.rb
    
    But there are caveats: Applets don't work with native libraries, so 
    no OpenGL. If you're requiring other files that aren't part of the 
    standard Ruby distro, you'll need to include them as libraries, which 
    means: Drop them in a folder inside of "library". Use
    load_ruby_library("folder_name") or load_java_library() to load 'em.
    These methods replace the previous load_library(). Ruby libs will 
    load the .rb with the same name as the folder. Java libs will just 
    load up all of the .jars in the folder.
    
    Demos — all of the standard samples are available as applets:
    http://fiercefrontiers.com/applets/jwishy/
    http://fiercefrontiers.com/applets/tree/
    http://fiercefrontiers.com/applets/circle_collision/
    http://fiercefrontiers.com/applets/reflection/
    

v0.5. With Native Libraries
  * Ruby-Processing gets easy native library support. Now you can take 
    Processing libraries, drop them in the library folder, and load them 
    up like so (inside your sketch):
    
    load_library "opengl"
    
    It works by loading up all of the .jars in that folder, and setting
    the java.library.path to that folder, so that the native extensions
    can be found.
    
  * Full Screen OpenGL demo added, but you'll need to copy over the 
    OpenGL library to use it.

v0.4. Going Fullscreen
  * Ruby-Processing goes fullscreen. Just pass :full_screen => true 
    into the options when you’re starting up your app. Like so:

    MyApp.new(:title => "MyApp", :full_screen => true)

  * Because Processing has just so many methods, you can now search 
    through them: find_method "method_name"

v0.3. First Real Release
  * Processing::App.current will give you a handle on the app. (Useful 
    in jirb).
  * samples/jwishy.rb has some new hooks for live coding.
  * circle_collision and tree samples added (Joe Holt)
