## Contributing
In the spirit of [free software][free-sw], **everyone** is encouraged to help improve this project.

Here are some ways *you* can contribute:

* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting new features
* by writing or editing documentation (expert Windows users could help write install instructions)
* by contributing examples
* by refactoring examples to be more rubyfied
* by closing [issues][]
* by proselytizing ruby-processing, we need more champions
* by supporting [Processing.org][], nothing to do with us but we rely on them

## Submitting an Issue
We use the [GitHub issue tracker][issues] to track bugs and features. Before
submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't
already been submitted. When submitting a bug report, ideally include a [Gist][]
that includes a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce
the bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system.
