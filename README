  Ruby-Processing is a Ruby wrapper for the Processing code art framework. It's
  this thin little shim that squeezes between Processing and JRuby, passing 
  along some neat goodies like:
  
  * Applet and Application exporting of your sketches. Hand them out to 
    your party guests, ready-to-run.
    
  * Live Coding via JRuby's IRB. Loads in your sketch so you can futz with 
    variables and remake methods on the fly.
    
  * A "Control Panel" library, so that you can easily create sliders, buttons,
    checkboxes and drop-down menus, and hook them into your sketch's instance 
    variables.
    
  * "Watch" mode, where Ruby-Processing keeps an eye on your sketch and reloads 
    it from scratch every time you make a change. A pretty nice REPL-ish way
    to work on your Processing sketches.
    
  If some quality time with Ruby is your idea of a pleasant afternoon, or you
  harbor ambitions of entering the fast-paced and not altogether cutthroat world 
  of Code Art, then Ruby-Processing is probably something you should try on for 
  size. You can grab it as a gem:
  
  sudo gem install ruby-processing
    
    
  ~ But Processing? ~
  
  Processing is an MIT-developed framework for making little code artifacts, 
  animations, visualizations, and the like, developed originally by Ben Fry
  and Casey Reas, supported by a small army of open-source contributors. 
  Processing has become a sort of standard for visually-oriented programming,
  strongly influencing the designs of Nodebox, Shoes, Arduino, and other kindred
  projects. For more information, take a look at http://processing.org/
  
  
  ~ What does it look like? How does it smell? ~
  
  Processing provides a tidy API, with a bunch of handy methods you can call 
  from Ruby-Processing. Here's a smattering:
  
  alpha, arc, background, blend, blue, ellipse, frame_rate, hue, lerp, 
  load_image, load_pixels, mouse_pressed, noise, rect, saturation, shape, 
  smooth, text_align, translate, triangle...
  
  And so on, and so forth. See the full list here:
